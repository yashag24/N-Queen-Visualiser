# N-Queens-Visualiser


 <h1>Welcome to N-Queen Visualizer with Backtracking</h1>
    
    <p>An interactive web application that allows you to visualize the solution to the classic N-Queens problem using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the Backtracking algorithm.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Interactive Visual Representation:</b> Visualize the N-Queens problem solution in real-time.</li>
        <li><b>Customizable Chessboard Size:</b> Choose the size of the chessboard (N) and observe how the queens are placed to avoid attacks.</li>
        <li><b>Step-by-Step Visualization:</b> Watch the Backtracking algorithm solve the N-Queens problem efficiently, with each step displayed interactively.</li>
        <li><b>Adjustable Animation Speed:</b> Control the speed of the visualization process to suit your preference.</li>
        <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices for a seamless user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Select Chessboard Size (N):</b> Use the interface to select the size of the chessboard.</li>
        <li><b>Start Visualization:</b> Initiate the visualization to see the queens being placed step-by-step.</li>
        <li><b>Control Animation Speed:</b> Adjust the speed of the animation using the provided controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>HTML:</b> For structuring the web page.</li>
        <li><b>CSS:</b> For styling the application.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript:</b> For implementing the Backtracking algorithm and interactive features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>The application uses the Backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The algorithm is visualized step-by-step, allowing users to understand the process and see how the solution is built incrementally.</p>

    <p>With this N-Queen Visualizer, you can deepen your understanding of the N-Queens problem and the Backtracking algorithm, all through an engaging and interactive web experience. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of algorithmic problem-solving!</p>
